Javascript is a Highlevel, (asking computer to allot memory but in JS &python js will only do)
prototype based,
object oriented,
multi paradigm,
interpreted or just in time compiled , ()
dynamic,
single threaded,
garbage collected, (js engine will remove garbage time to time)
non bloclking event loop concurrency model 
 


interpreted ->code will be converted to machine code and will be executed line by line(1 step)
compiation->code will be converted to machine code and written to a binary file that can be executed(2 steps)


Java script in just in time compiled as code will code converted and executed immediately
Javascript Engine has 2 things.Call stack(where our code will be executed by using Execution Context) and heap memory(where variables will be saved)

Javascript Engine does these things:
1.Parsing the code and creating a Abstract Syntax Tree 
2.Compiling this AST and compiles into Mahcine code
3.THis machine code will be executed immediately.

and we will get started with our application 
But modern Javascript Engines like (V8) will get started with fairly unoptimized code and then recompiles and re execute So 2&3 steps will be repeating


JavascriptRun time includes JS engine,Web APIS(like DOM,Fetch APi etc) and Call Back Queue(which is adding the functions into queue w.r.t user action like click etc)
This call back Queue will be sent into Call Stack and will be executed by Event loop.
